# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Flutter-UI-App
A simple, clean Flutter app to upload MRI images and view tumor predictions.

This Flutter application allows users to upload an MRI brain image from their device and receive:

* Predicted tumor type

* Confidence score

* A clean and responsive UI to display results

The prediction is performed by a connected backend (such as your Streamlit/ML API). The app focuses on clarity, ease of use, and fast interaction.
